Description: Complex analysis is a fundamental in developing solution to many practical problems. It discusses the calculus of complex functions with the main results around Cauchy’s Theorem, Cauchy’s integral formula, and the existence of Taylor and Laurent series. In the last part of the course, students will also learn the application of complex analysis, namely Fourier series and Fourier transform
