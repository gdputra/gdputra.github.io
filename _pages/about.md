Hi! I am an assistant professor in Information Technology at [Department of Electrical and Information Engineering](https://jteti.ugm.ac.id/), [Universitas Gadjah Mada](https://ugm.ac.id/en).

My research mainly revolves around **_cyber-physical systems_** and **_applications of AI/ML_**. In the past few years, I have been exploring **_blockchain_** related applications in **_securing the internet of things_** and _distributed systems_ in general. Quite recently, I am also exploring the _applications of machine learning in the field of climate and energy_.

We list our publications [here](https://gdputra.github.io/publications/) and we host our research as open-source projects on our [GitHub organization](https://github.com/dteti-sys-rsch). Please have a look!
